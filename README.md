# heroku-puppeteer

Sane boilerplate for working with puppeteer on heroku without having to deal with 1000's of issues with Chromium and heroku not liking each other.

## Usage

- You'll need the heroku puppeteer buildpack added to your heroku app, `https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack.git`

```sh
npx degit barelyhuman/heroku-puppeteer example-scraper
cd barelyhuman/heroku-puppeteer
npm i
```
